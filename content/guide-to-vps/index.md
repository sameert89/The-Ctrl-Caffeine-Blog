A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is like renting a small slice of a powerful computer in a data center. It looks and feels like your own Linux or Windows machine, but it runs on shared physical hardware.

This guide covers:

- What a VPS is
- How to set one up
- How to **harden** (secure) it
- Fun and practical things you can do

## What is a VPS?

- **Virtual Private:** Itâ€™s isolatedâ€”other customers canâ€™t access your data.
- **Server:** Runs 24/7 and can host websites, apps, and services.

Compared to shared hosting, a VPS gives you:

âœ… Root access  
âœ… Flexibility to install anything  
âœ… Better performance and isolation  

Common providers:
- DigitalOcean
- Linode
- Hetzner
- AWS Lightsail

## Getting Started

After ordering your VPS, you typically get:

- An **IP address** (e.g., `203.0.113.5`)
- A **root password** or SSH key login

Connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@203.0.113.5
```

First steps:

1. **Update packages:**

```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade
```

2. **Create a new user:**

   ```bash
   adduser myuser
   usermod -aG sudo myuser
   ```

3. **Add SSH keys:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/myuser/.ssh
   nano /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   Paste your public key, save, and set permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chown -R myuser:myuser /home/myuser/.ssh
   ```

4. **Disable root SSH login:**

   Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   PermitRootLogin no
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

   Restart SSH:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart ssh
   ```

## Hardening Your VPS

Securing your server is **critical**. Here are essentials:

âœ… **Firewall (UFW):**

```bash
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable
```

âœ… **Fail2ban (brute force protection):**

```bash
apt install fail2ban
systemctl enable fail2ban --now
```

âœ… **Automatic security updates:**

```bash
apt install unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
```

âœ… **Minimal services:**

Disable unused services:

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
systemctl disable <service>
```

âœ… **Regular backups:**

- Use `rsync` or snapshots.
- Test restoring backups periodically.
